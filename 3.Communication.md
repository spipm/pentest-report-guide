# 3. Communication

Writing is about communication. Before, during and after we write a report we need to be communicative to ourselves and to our customers.

## 3.1. The intake call

Use the intake call to learn about the values and needs that surround the scope. Ask about the worst case scenario, so you can use it as a theme in your story. If you can uncover why the pentest was requested you can adjust your writing to it.

The intake can also be used to tune the scope if the wrong type of assignment was requested. For example, I had a client who planned a pentest on their company website and a scan of their external infrastructure. When asked about the worst case scenario, they answered that they planned the pentest because they were afraid of ransomware attacks. I explained that they'd be better off assessing things like their backup capabilities. They were thankful and decided to steer the project in that direction.

Aim to agree on a list of the requirements that are needed to test all functionality in scope. Also reach consensus about the duration of the pentest. A concrete start date can later be discussed via email.

## 3.2. Report while you pentest

Start writing findings during the pentest. Ideally you'd do this while testing, but I found it to disrupt my flow. What works for me is noting the basics at the end of the day of confirming the vulnerability. With basics I mean loosely couples sentences for the details, the impact and the recommendation. We need at least the basic information so we can write out the finding if the testing environment goes down, so also dump in evidence like screenshots.

## 3.3. Asking the devs

Discussing findings with developers can help improve the quality of a pentest. You can learn about the root cause, how shocked they are to find it, if it is a structural issue, and what they think the proper solution is. Clients also tend to love this approach because you're doing part of the work for them. Managers with a working moral compass can't be happier if a vulnerability is halfway fixed when they read the report. It shows that you're really stepping up to better their company, and it lets developers know that you have no intention of bypassing them to brown-nose management.

## 3.4. The findings meeting

A findings meeting is an essential part of the pentest process. It is the presentation of the story that sets the tone of the results. Present the findings that make up the themes from the conclusion. Consider skipping low-risk findings if you run out of time, and give others a chance to speak and ask questions.

## 3.6. Expectation management

Expectation management is vital for smooth delivery of a product. Think of this like a trailer to the story of your report. Their imaginations will play this trailer on a loop before and during the assessment. If the story of the report turns out to be completely different, it can ruin the whole experience, regardless of results.

Try to steer away from ambiguous or vague statements like "_We expect to deliver the report shortly_". What does shortly mean? Just pick a day, and just make sure you timely communicate if you aren't going to make it. You can get away with "_We expect to deliver it early next week_" if you're not sure you can deliver it by Monday or Tuesday. Just don't keep quiet if it is going to be Wednesday or later.

Communicate high-risk vulnerabilities during the assessment. Also tell them if it is an easy fix or not. The client can decide if they'll start fixing parallel to the pentest. Don't forget to mention that you'd rather not have them deploy new things to your testing environment until the pentest is done. Sometimes when I find a high-risk on Friday afternoon, I wait until Monday, because I know nobody is going to pick it up and the poor ISO will just lose sleep on it.

Expectation management is also about _meeting_ expectations. It doesn't always need to come from pro-active heads-ups. For example, a client expects to at least find something useful in a report. A pentest without findings can be made nice by adding what has been tested, which tests failed, or by describing security controls that are well established. You can also level their expectations by informing them that nothing of interest was found halfway into the pentest. Just don't let their imaginations race for a week only to be handed a bunch of blank papers.

## 3.7. Being proactive

Meet the client's expectations and exceed them when possible. This can be as simple as asking the right questions. I was once testing an application in a production environment that had some auto-login link to a bug tracker. In the room were the development team and the Risk Assessor (person managing the pentest), who said the bug tracker was out of scope because it "didn't contain production data". Clicking the auto-login link seemed to work, so I asked the developers how this was possible, who answered "oh yeah we sync those accounts from prod". Turns out you could hack the bugtracker (MantisBT) to obtain production accounts for escalating privileges. The Risk Assessor - who was surprised to learn about this - changes the risk rating for the tracker and we put it in scope. The insight for tuning business risk added a dimension of collaboration. This was a small interaction but it elevated the pentest-experience.

## 3.8. Positivity

Our job is to make people enthusiastic about security so we can guide them towards improvement. We build routes to better security with concise findings and eloquently tailored solutions. Part of doing this job properly is keeping up morale. If there are too many findings, we'll advise to focus on the high-risk ones. If the proper long-term solutions overwhelm them, we'll provide simpler short-term solutions so they can at least make a start. Motivation, morale and enthusiasm all stem from positivity. This is how we lead and motivate customers to make their companies more secure.

It is essential to work towards positivity inside yourself. Remember that security can't exist without someone valuing something. This means that if you can't see value in the world, it'll become a challenge to imagine the security needs of your customer. This valuing of the world starts by valuing the self, even when you [miss vulnerabilities](https://www.securify.nl/blog/staying-positive-about-false-negatives/), mess up communication or curse your job and especially those fucking clients. These things happen, but they are all temporary. What's important is that you manage the self like you manage your client's; guide yourself towards improvements, because you can always get better, and that is something worth being positive about.
