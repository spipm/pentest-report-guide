## 5.1. Chapter 1 - Writing

### 5.1.1 Think of three buzzwords for everyday life

Here we are just having fun expressing an idea using creative word association. Examples:
* microwave-compatible dinner
* rollerblade-soothing pavement
* brain-shattering orgasm
* .. [insert your thoughts] ..

### 5.1.2 Find words that are softer

Imagine you're writing a report conclusion. The results are kind of harsh so you want to balance it by using words that are rounder, softer or less loaded. Find a match for the following words to attain that goal.

* Example: terrifying, formidable
* attacker, ..?
* virus, ..?
* rectify, ..?

### 5.1.3 Read Shakespeare

Read Shakespeare his [18th Sonnet](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45087/sonnet-18-shall-i-compare-thee-to-a-summers-day). Enjoy the words and their rhythm. Try to identify the story structure, as in, the beginning, the middle and the end. Where do you feel the tension is at its peak?

### 5.1.3 Choose your archetypes

Link the following five personas to one of the common archetypes below: developer, pentester, attacker, the company, the phishing victim. Link them to the archetype that you think your client will most likely view them as.

* Hero: The protagonist who embarks on a quest or journey, typically displaying bravery, courage, and a sense of duty.
* Mentor: A wise and experienced figure who guides and provides wisdom to the hero.
* Trickster: A mischievous character who uses wit, deception, or humor to disrupt the status quo.
* Explorer: A character driven by curiosity and a desire for adventure, often journeying into the unknown.
* Rebel: A character who challenges authority or the established order, often seeking change or liberation.
* Villain: The antagonist who opposes the hero and represents evil or conflict.
* Innocent: A character who represents purity, naivety, and a lack of experience.
* Creator/Innovator: A character who brings something new into the world, whether it's an invention, art, or ideas.
* Ruler/King: A character who holds power and authority, often responsible for maintaining order and justice.

### 5.1.4 Archetype bonus questions

* Does your client see their company or you as the hero who's embarking on a journey? Or in other words, if they're paying for a pentest, is that their journey or yours? Are you the main character or a side-character?
* Can an application or a server act a character in the story?

### 5.1.4 Write a Shakespearean sonnet

Check out Wikipedia at ["Form and structure of the sonnets"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_sonnets#Form_and_structure_of_the_sonnets). The scheme is: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Construct sentences using the [iambic pentameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pentameter), or five "da-DUM"s if you will.

## 5.2. Chapter 2 - Content

### 5.2.1. Write an impact description

Write an impact description using the method described in 2.4.4 (Impact description).

### 5.2.2. Create a recommendation

Suppose a website has an HTML editor that allows users to create blog posts with additional layout, but the users can use it to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against each other. What would be your recommendation?

Hint: Applying output encoding is the wrong answer.

### 5.2.3. Rewrite a paragraph

Give the following paragraph a professional make-over. Make it at least less opinionated and better readable. Also consider splitting it in two.

"_The Foo application has bad security. Developers should step up their game and learn real security. They are doing a bad job at securing their application. Don't take this application into production!_"

### 5.2.4. Write a conclusion paragraph

Write a single paragraph that describes the results from the following three findings:
* An administrative account in production has weak, guessable credentials.
* 2FA tokens aren't protected against brute-force attacks.
* The application doesn't produce an audit trail for login attempts.

### 5.2.5. Estimate a risk

Let's say I found an SQL-Injection vulnerability in a documentation tool. The SQL user only has read access to public data, and no additional rights like DB Admin. Would you rate it Low, Medium or High? Would you even consider it a finding?

## 5.3. Chapter 3 - Communication

### 5.3.1. Spot the core task

Consider the following excerpt from an intake call:
"_In scope are three applications and a custom SSO API. Employees will eventually use this API to access all internal applications. We chose these three applications as a pilot group before we continue development. We haven't pentested the SSO API before._"

Think of an argument for performing a white-box assessment on the SSO API. Can you think of an important theme for this story?

### 5.3.2. Expectation management expectations

Think of three cases where you should manage expectations. Two examples are given.

* When there are so many high-risk issues that you have to stop testing and start reporting to deliver the report on time.
* When you're behind on schedule and it looks like you won't be able to deliver proper results in the agreed time frame.
* .. [insert cases] ..

### 5.3.3. Proactive cases

* A company has an internal SOC that is testing their monitoring capabilities. Which detail can you pro-actively add to the findings of a Red Team assignment?
* You're on-site, testing an application that is 'only accessible via the internal network'. In the waiting area where guests are picked up you spot a network socket. Think of a proactive test to perform, and how you should go about executing it.
* A colleague accidentally scanned an out-of-scope network range and found a vulnerability. How would you communicate this? And how will you incorporate this into the report?

### 5.3.4. List positive things

Make a list of five things that you experience as positive. Three examples are given. If you can't think of anything positive, write positive negatives, e.g. "_At least I'm not currently being eaten by sharks_". If you'd rather be eaten by sharks at the moment, you can always go with the passive aggressive "_It is positive that this meeting is two hours instead of four_".

Examples:
* Walking in nature
* Walking on grass with bare feet
* Writing two sentences underneath each other that happen to be exactly the same length
* .. [insert positive things you like] ..
